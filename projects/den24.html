                <p>DEN24 was a campaign for our first year representative as part of our student union. As a team, we led our candidate to a landslide success. It wasn't even close.</p>
                <p>I was on Web Design and Social Media. (Short and 'long' form)</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Website</h2>
                    <p>We had a logotype done by <a href="https://instagram.com/de_orfeu">Fernando V,</a> (of <a href="scottroadband.html">Scott Road</a> fame!) so I used those colours on the site.</p>
                    <p>A column-focused layout made text more or less readable. (line length) The font (Syne) is bold and dynamic, reflecting the candidate's personality. The default monospace font otherwise gave a Y2Kish aesthetic.</p>
                <h3>Criticism</h3>
                    <p>The site is... a bit messy. Hierarchy isn't established super well, and I had to rely on the white borders to separate ideas. This was also one of the first times I tried to <i>actually</i> use flexbox.</p>
                    <p>Things are a little too big as well. The body text is huge! Also, a monospace typeface isn't the best readability, despite the less wide columns.</p>
                    <p>That being said, it was functional. It was our 'one place' for all our links, videos, and campaign. I made it super quickly, so I guess it's not bad.</p>
                    <br>
                <h2>The Content</h2>
                    <p>The first campaign video was pretty standard stuff. Just a candidate outlining her values, selling you on voting for her, etc., but it was pretty long. So naturally, we had to cut down.</p>
                    <p>The first short video was <i>heavily</i> trimmed down, and maximalized to all hell. I wanted to parody/pastiche the TikTok 'brainrot' editing style, throwing all nuance out the window. It was... actually pretty good.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent videos followed this formula: a calmer, more informative long video, followed by a shorter, engaging summary.</p>
                <h3>Criticism</h3>
                    <p>I think I should've started with the shorts first. Barely anyone watched the long-form videos, but the shorts did super well!</p>
                    <p>I also think I should've used the built-in tools more. I have more control in Final Cut, but I think I got some diminishing returns out of it. If I used the inherent jankiness of the social media tools, it probably would have the same effect... I think.</p>
                    <p>Overall, still really happy with the videos, even if it did take multiple years off of my life.</p>
